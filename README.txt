METROX - SMART CHENNAI METRO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FRONTEND)

HOW TO OPEN
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open auth.html in a browser.
3. Demo logins:
   Regular user -> Email: demo@metrox.com   Password: metrox123
   Admin        -> Email: admin@metrox.com  Password: admin123
   (or click Register to create your own account — new accounts are regular users)

ADMIN ACCESS
- Only the admin account can see and open the Admin Panel link; it is hidden for
  regular users, and a regular user opening admin/admin-dashboard.html directly is
  redirected back to the dashboard.
- Stations added in the Admin Panel are saved to the shared station list and
  immediately appear in Route Finder, Fare Calculator, Travel Time, Metro Lines,
  QR Ticket and Nearby Station for every user — not just in the admin page.

NEARBY STATION FINDER — MOBILE NOTE
- Browsers (Chrome/Safari on mobile especially) block the GPS/location API on
  pages opened directly from a file (file://) for security. If "Find Stations
  Near Me" cannot get your location, host these files with a simple local server
  or open them over HTTPS, and allow the location permission when prompted.
  Until then, the page shows the nearest stations to Chennai Central as a fallback.

IMPORTANT
- This is a frontend/demo project. Data is stored in the browser's localStorage.
- SMS/Email OTP recovery, QR ticket and Live Train status are simulated demo features
  (no real SMS/email gateway or live train API is connected).
- For a real deployment, connect a backend (e.g. Spring Boot + MySQL as in the original
  Smart Metro Management System project overview) and real metro data/APIs.
